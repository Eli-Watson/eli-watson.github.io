### Theme update for Article site.
I made a theme for Hugo bc I did't like the one I had before, don't get me wrong, the theme was great, but It didn't fit with what I wanted the rest of the site to be. So I made my own. I think it looks kinda  like the classic web, as thats about the level my css skills are at. Funny thing, When making this theme to fit more with my main site, I found a color way I like better than the main site. 

### Changes to the Main site; "Home"
I will probbly recode the main site bc its become a hot mess, as over time I have added in random features and rigged in diffrent things, like the color custimization for instance. I will probbly  make it a simple dark and light mode, with options to change the accent color. I will probbly also change the file structure to be more inline with best practices and combine some of the JS scripts into one file, as currently each page loads like 3-5 and they could esaly be combined.
