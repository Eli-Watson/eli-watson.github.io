# Nostaw

I made yet another website repackagaing the same content just for fun. But whatever, im making new content as we speak so get over it. Anyway, the site is a IOS Web-App thing. All that bassicly means is that if you add it to your homescreen it will act like an app and not open a tab in your webbrower. It's not hard Just a few tags in the Head. But It kinda just looks like neal.fun with some basic THREE.js to make it look like I know what im doing.

# BasicCraft

Added this a while ago but never adknowlaged it, so yeah. It's basiclly a modified version of the three.js example "Voxel Painter" It's a deccent time waster.

# Future of this site

~INSERT CONTENT~

Haha just kidding that will never happen, im too busy implementing random fetures  I think are cool. 

# Demos  
ANOTHER website that just has my code demos. Like my Mad-Lib Generator. Go look at it. Please.
