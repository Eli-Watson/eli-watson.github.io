# What I added
If you have read one of my ealier posts on what I wanted to add a chat server, mostly becuase I think its cool. Now I struggle to find the software. Then I discovered irc. Now irc has  been around for a looooong time but I juest never ran across it before now. Now how it works will be a little too much for this short post but its pretty easy to look up. Now I am not hosting my own server, but I do have a channel on one of the biggest irc networks, Libra chat. So how do you get to my channel? Well I embeded a Kiwi Irc, Again look it up for more details, into my site so you can chat directly from it. Go try it out!
