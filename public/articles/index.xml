      <title>3DS Modding</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/3ds/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so&amp;hellip; The nentendeo 3Ds. I currently own two, a 3DS XL and a (New) 3DS Xl. Both are softmodded but the of 3DS XL is not currently working. The ribbon cable connecter clip for the lower screen is broken and as such the lower screen does not display anything unless the cable is pysicly placed inside the connector and held their. And no tape does not work. But that is not what this article is about. In an attepmt to reserch ways to fix it, I stumbled across the world of 3DS hard mods and it got me hooked. Now, i&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about the software side of things becuase there are numerous resources on that side of things, but not as much about hard mods. Now when I say hard mods I mean anything that changes the pyhisical hardware of the 3DS. Anything from adding a usb-c port to adding a capture card is a hard mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-what-to-add&#34;&gt;So what to add?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loopy controller mod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usb-c (if it fits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;parts&#34;&gt;Parts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now im going to go into further detail on each mod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-catpture-card&#34;&gt;-Catpture Card&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cool one. It would allow me to hook up my 3ds to a computer do capture the screen over hardware and either use the montor like a big screen or record the footage. Now you can do this over software and their are countless homebrew programs that do so, but this is much faster and can be done offline. And its cool. Now as for witch capture card to use I have a few choices, I could try and track down and old loopy unit but that would likley be difficult and expensive. Another sorce for one, and the route I will probbalby go is buying from Optimize. They are a japanesse brand that ships internatinally and there is a large ammount of english material on this particular card, both on youtube and not. And its not that expensive if you are paying with USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-loopy-controller-mod&#34;&gt;-Loopy Controller Mod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is an intereseting one, it allows you to hook up a large selection of controllers ranging from snes to gamecube to the 3ds with full fucntionality. You can even use the Gamecube&amp;rsquo;s c stick in Smash Bros! But the main challenge with this mod is that he no longer makes a board you can just buy, and it is going to be hard to solder. As for acctually obtaining the board there are a few diffrent sellers online and if you are interesting in picking one up I would look on loopys fourm. There will most likley be someone on their selling one. Alternivly he has posted the design and firmware to make one, you will probbalby have to use the wayback machine to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-usb-c&#34;&gt;-USB-C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said if there is space becasue between the Capture card and Controller mod itll be a pretty tight fit. This one is the easyest of the bunch, there are countless youtube videos detailing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these mods together you have bassicly made a consolized 3ds. If you wanted to forgo the case completley and make a custom container that would be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;loopy&amp;rsquo;s website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://3dscapture.com/&#34;&gt;https://3dscapture.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Balisong (Butterfly Knife)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/balisong/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/balisong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balisong is a pilipino knife made famous by video games and flashy tricks. But how good is it for a EDC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins-of-the-balisong&#34;&gt;Origins of the Balisong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balisong, also known as the Butterfly Knife, originated in the philippines as a reliable and simple utility knife. Its design consists of two handles and a blade witch rotate to open and close the blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;balis-for-edc&#34;&gt;Bali&amp;rsquo;s for EDC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all what is EDC? EDC means Every Day Carry and refers to what knife you carry daily for utility and defense, depending on you priority&amp;rsquo;s. For me it would be mostly  utility but defense is still a focus. Now the major disadvantage of a bali for edc isn&amp;rsquo;t even anything about the knife itself, it is the public perception of the knife and it being regarded as a switchblade. Now since I live in Louisiana, where it is legal, this is less of a concern for me but depending where you live you might be in deep waters. So check your local laws to make sure you wont get fined or something. But back to the Bali itself. So you might be asking &amp;ldquo;What is the purpose of such a thing?&amp;rdquo; Well, it is a folding knife with the strength of a fixed blade. Also it is one of the easiest knifes, besides a auto, to deploy one handed. So if one hand is occupied then you can still open your knife and use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bali-conststruction&#34;&gt;Bali Conststruction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balisongs are traditonally Made with either wood or bamboo as handles and may or may not feture Latches. While this is still diffrent from the original balis wich were made with whatever mateials were avalible locally.

      <title>How this Website Works</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/about/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/about/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is to explain the backed of this website, and my ratinal behind the way it is. I hope this offers some insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hosting&#34;&gt;Hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sites is hosted on Github pages. Why? the awnser is very very simple. It is Free. and easy to edit from anywhere. this can cause some security risks but as I am not housing any sensitive data then its fine. This Website is acctually two websites, as it is two diffrent github repos. The first houses the main site and all its content. The second houses this Hugo site that you are currently reading this article on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-two-repos&#34;&gt;Why two repos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially just had the main site and had all the articles linked off of it, but when it came time to make new articles, it began to become very tidious to code all of the html and css for the page that I was not motivated to accually write anything. Also I wanted some of my firends to write some areticles for my website and Learning Markdown Is a signifiganly lower barrier of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-actual-code&#34;&gt;The Actual Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the site is coded in Html, obviously, as that is the only thing github pages supports. But I have heabily used js and css to enhance the site, besides the links page (If you want to know why to read the explaination there). All of the css and js are in external files so that I can resue them esily between Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Make a CoilGun (Gauss Rifle)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/coilgun/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/coilgun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intoroduction&#34;&gt;Intoroduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Gauss rifle, also known as a coil gun, is a fascinating electromagnetic device that accelerates
ferromagnetic projectiles using high-voltage coils. This article delves into the intricacies of multistage
coilguns, exploring the necessary components, principles, and applications of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multistage-coilgun&#34;&gt;Multistage Coilgun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multistage coilgun is a sophisticated electromagnetic launcher comprised of multiple coil stages arranged
along a barrel. Each stage contributes to the acceleration of the projectile, resulting in significant
velocity gains over the length of the barrel. The design of a multistage coilgun requires careful
consideration of coil geometry, timing, and power distribution to optimize performance.
The key challenge in multistage coilgun design lies in efficiently transferring momentum to the projectile
without prematurely decelerating it. To address this, precise control of the switching circuitry is essential.
By deactivating each coil stage before the projectile reaches the center of the coil, the magnetic forces can
be utilized to propel the projectile forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;switching-circuitry&#34;&gt;Switching Circuitry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching circuitry plays a crucial role in the operation of a coilgun, ensuring precise timing and control
over the magnetic forces acting on the projectile. MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect
Transistors) are commonly employed for high-voltage switching applications due to their fast switching speed
and low on-resistance.
In a multistage coilgun, the switching circuitry coordinates the activation and deactivation of each coil
stage as the projectile traverses the barrel. Timing is critical to ensure that the coils are deactivated
before the projectile reaches the center, preventing it from being pulled back and maximizing acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;power-source&#34;&gt;Power Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of power source for a coilgun depends on the desired application and performance requirements.
Multiple large batteries can provide a steady supply of power for repeated firings, making them suitable for
applications where rapid-fire capability is essential. Alternatively, a capacitor bank can deliver a
high-voltage pulse for a single powerful shot, ideal for applications where maximum velocity is paramount.
Regardless of the power source chosen, efficient energy management is essential to optimize the performance of
the coilgun. Capacitor banks require careful charging and discharging mechanisms to deliver the necessary
energy to each coil stage, while batteries must be capable of supplying high currents without voltage sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;projectile-injection&#34;&gt;Projectile Injection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injecting the projectile into the first coil stage is a critical step in the operation of a coilgun. A
solenoid pusher is commonly used for this purpose, providing precise control over the timing and velocity of
the projectile&amp;rsquo;s entry into the barrel. By activating the solenoid electrically, the projectile can be
propelled into the coilgun with consistent force, ensuring reliable operation.
The design of the projectile injection mechanism must account for factors such as projectile size, weight, and
magnetic properties to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, safety considerations are paramount to
prevent accidental firing or damage to the coilgun components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coilguns, or Gauss guns, represent a fascinating intersection of electromagnetism and projectile physics. By
leveraging the principles of multistage acceleration, precise switching circuitry, and efficient power
management, coilguns can achieve impressive velocities and kinetic energies.
As technology advances, coilguns continue to find new applications in fields such as aerospace, defense, and
research. By understanding the fundamental principles and design considerations outlined in this article,
engineers and enthusiasts can explore the vast potential of coilgun technology and push the boundaries of
electromagnetic propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
