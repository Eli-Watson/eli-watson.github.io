	<h1>3DS Modding</h1>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>so&hellip; The nentendeo 3Ds. I currently own two, a 3DS XL and a (New) 3DS Xl. Both are softmodded but the of 3DS XL is not currently working. The ribbon cable connecter clip for the lower screen is broken and as such the lower screen does not display anything unless the cable is pysicly placed inside the connector and held their. And no tape does not work. But that is not what this article is about. In an attepmt to reserch ways to fix it, I stumbled across the world of 3DS hard mods and it got me hooked. Now, i&rsquo;m not going to talk about the software side of things becuase there are numerous resources on that side of things, but not as much about hard mods. Now when I say hard mods I mean anything that changes the pyhisical hardware of the 3DS. Anything from adding a usb-c port to adding a capture card is a hard mod.</p>
<h1 id="so-what-to-add">So what to add?</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture card</li>
<li>loopy controller mod</li>
<li>usb-c (if it fits)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="parts">Parts</h1>
<p>Now im going to go into further detail on each mod</p>
<h3 id="-catpture-card">-Catpture Card</h3>
<p>This is a cool one. It would allow me to hook up my 3ds to a computer do capture the screen over hardware and either use the montor like a big screen or record the footage. Now you can do this over software and their are countless homebrew programs that do so, but this is much faster and can be done offline. And its cool. Now as for witch capture card to use I have a few choices, I could try and track down and old loopy unit but that would likley be difficult and expensive. Another sorce for one, and the route I will probbalby go is buying from Optimize. They are a japanesse brand that ships internatinally and there is a large ammount of english material on this particular card, both on youtube and not. And its not that expensive if you are paying with USD.</p>
<h3 id="-loopy-controller-mod">-Loopy Controller Mod</h3>
<p>Now this is an intereseting one, it allows you to hook up a large selection of controllers ranging from snes to gamecube to the 3ds with full fucntionality. You can even use the Gamecube&rsquo;s c stick in Smash Bros! But the main challenge with this mod is that he no longer makes a board you can just buy, and it is going to be hard to solder. As for acctually obtaining the board there are a few diffrent sellers online and if you are interesting in picking one up I would look on loopys fourm. There will most likley be someone on their selling one. Alternivly he has posted the design and firmware to make one, you will probbalby have to use the wayback machine to find it.</p>
<h3 id="-usb-c">-USB-C</h3>
<p>I said if there is space becasue between the Capture card and Controller mod itll be a pretty tight fit. This one is the easyest of the bunch, there are countless youtube videos detailing this.</p>
<h1 id="afterword">Afterword</h1>
<p>With all these mods together you have bassicly made a consolized 3ds. If you wanted to forgo the case completley and make a custom container that would be cool.</p>
